### 4. Claude Desktop with MCP Servers
**Status:** ✅ Completed (GitHub MCP server successfully connected and running)

Claude Desktop successfully loaded the MCP configuration file with 4 servers configured.  
Rolldice / Bootcamp / Calendar servers are configured and showing warning icons as expected for the current workshop stage, while the GitHub MCP server is fully running and able to access my repository.


#### **Server 1: Rolldice**

## 🔧 MCP Servers: Purpose & Functionality

### 1. **Rolldice Server**
- **Category:** Example/Tutorial Server
- **Functionality:** Generates random numbers, simulates dice rolls
- **Use Case:** Learning MCP tool calling patterns and basic function execution
- **Key Learning:** Demonstrates request/response flow between Claude and external tools

### 2. **Bootcamp AI Agent Server**
- **Category:** Development Tools Server
- **Functionality:** Provides AI agent training environment interaction
- **Use Case:** Managing bootcamp-specific workflows, tracking progress, accessing learning resources
- **Key Learning:** Shows how MCP can integrate domain-specific tools into AI workflows

### 3. **Calendar Booking Server**
- **Category:** Scheduling & Time Management Server
- **Functionality:** Creates, reads, updates calendar events; checks availability
- **Use Case:** Scheduling meetings, setting reminders, managing time-sensitive tasks
- **Key Learning:** Demonstrates stateful operations and time-based logic in MCP

### 4. **GitHub MCP Server**
- **Category:** Developer Productivity Server
- **Functionality:** Repository management, issue tracking, pull request automation
- **Use Case:** AI-assisted code review, automated issue creation, repository insights
- **Key Learning:** Real-world integration of AI with version control workflows

##  Troubleshooting Notes

### Issue: GitHub MCP Server Was Running but Not Responding to Commands

**Problem:**  
Although the GitHub MCP server showed **“Running”** in Claude Desktop, it did not respond to commands.  
For example, when I asked Claude to:

- list the files in the repository  
- retrieve README.md  
- access the root directory  

Claude returned errors such as:

- “No result received from client-side tool execution”
- “Repository not found”
- “Unable to access repository”

At first, it seemed like the MCP server itself was failing.

---

### Investigation Step 1: Suspected Token Permission Issue (But It Was Correct)

My first hypothesis was that the GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) might not have enough permissions.  
I checked my token settings and confirmed:

✔ `repo` permission was fully enabled  
✔ public and private repo access allowed  
✔ the token was correctly placed in `claude-desktop-config.json`  
✔ Claude Desktop was fully restarted to load the updated token  

**Result:**  
The PAT was correctly configured — token permissions were *not* the cause.

---

### Investigation Step 2: MCP Server Configuration  
I also checked the MCP server configuration inside `claude-desktop-config.json`.  
Everything was correct, and the server status remained **Running**, meaning Claude successfully authenticated with GitHub.

---

### Final Root Cause: Incorrect Repository Name

The actual issue was much simpler:

 Claude was trying to access the wrong repository name.  
The repository name in my command did not exactly match the actual GitHub repo.

GitHub MCP cannot access a repository that doesn’t exist → so it returned no results.

---

### Fix Implemented

I renamed the repository to a clean and correct format:

##  Key Insights

### AI Agent Developer Mindset Shift
The setup process revealed a fundamental shift from traditional development to AI-augmented workflows:

1. **Tool Integration Focus:** MCP servers demonstrate that AI agents become more powerful when connected to external tools rather than operating in isolation.

2. **Declarative Configuration:** The `claude-desktop-config.json` approach shows how modern AI development emphasizes declarative tool definitions over imperative programming.

3. **Multi-Tool Orchestration:** Having 4 different MCP servers highlights how AI agents can coordinate multiple specialized tools to accomplish complex tasks.

##  Conclusion

This repository demonstrates a fully functional AI Agent Developer environment with all required tools installed, configured, and verified. Through the setup of MCP servers—especially the successful connection of the GitHub MCP server—I gained hands-on experience with AI-enhanced development workflows and learned how AI can interact with external systems in practical ways.

The troubleshooting process, particularly identifying the repository name issue, strengthened my understanding of how MCP servers communicate with external tools and how important precise configuration is when working with AI-driven development environments.

By completing this setup and documenting every step, I have built a solid foundation for the upcoming weeks of the program. I am now fully prepared to continue developing AI-driven workflows, experiment with agentic behaviors, and deepen my ability to collaborate with AI as an active development partner.
